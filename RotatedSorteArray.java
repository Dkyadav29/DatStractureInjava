You have been given an integer array
sorted in ascending order with
distinct values. is rotated at an
unknown pivot index (
) such that the resulting
array is
(0-indexed).
For example, might be
rotated at pivot index and become
.
Given the array after the
rotation and an integer , print
the index of if it is in , or
if it is not in .
You must write an algorithm with
runtime complexity.
Input Format
The first line of input contains ,
size of the array
The second line of input contains
space-separated array
elements
The third line of the input
contains a single integer
denoting the number of test
cases. The description of test
cases follows.
Each test case consists of a
positive integer
